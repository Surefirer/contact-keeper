This project is part of Brad Traversy's react front to back course from udemy. In this course, I learned react fundamentals (components, props, state, etc), react hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef) in real projects as well as context API & App-level state. MERN - MongoDB, Express React, Node. Redux - Reducer, Actions.
